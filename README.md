A* is Born allows users to always find the shortest possible path in a maze, while
avoiding obstacles. To demonstrate the A* path finding algorithm properly, Webots, a desktop
application that uses digital robots and environments is implemented using Python. The maze is
used as unknown environment for the robot to traverse. A* is Born allows its users to find the
shortest possible path not only in a maze, but in any possible 2D or 3D environment that could
be virtually recreated.
